# YoutubeAdSkip 

Automatically mutes youtube ads as soon as they appear.
Skips ads within 1s of them appearing (regardless of countdown).
**UPDATE**: Now works on traditionally unskippable ads.

If you are using **Firefox** you can install the addons from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtubeadskip/

If you are using **Chrome** my extension submission was not approved. You can install the extension
by downloading the latest zip in the releases dir, open chrome://extensions/ in chrome, and drag the
zip into the window to install.
