# YoutubeAdSkip 

Automatically mutes youtube ads as soon as they appear and skips them as soon as possible. As of
writing there is some bug on youtube which means skip does not need to wait 5s and will happen near-
immediately.

If you are using **Firefox** you can install the addons from: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/youtubeadskip/edit

If you are using **Chrome** my extension submission was not approved. You can install the extension
by downloading the latest zip in the releases dir, open chrome://extensions/ in chrome, and drag the
zip into the window to install.
